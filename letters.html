        <p>So its been days since i sent u the letter. Its been 7 months since we met.It was full roller coaster ride with u.Too many fights,too many sweet talks etc. I know u well now, i know u better, i will get to know and experience lots of more things too. Last letter which i sent u was as a friend. This will be different. This will be something which i have in mind about u, the real things.
            <br>
            April-May:Met by simple coupon exchange deal.<br>
            The time when we started talking thorda, i dont remember exact dates of anything. This is the time when i got some impressions of your on me , which were:-<br>
            <br>1. kind
            <br>2. good person
            <br>3. Different aura
            <br>4. Smart
            <br>5. Arrogant
            <br>6. Atheist
            <br>7. Angry
            <br>8. Dont care about things
            
            <br>These were my various observations about u. Let me explain with incidents. kind for the "Lonely trader money return incident" , you are so good that you were not telling the amount too, not that only. you always think about the poor and the society. Atheist toh you are hi. Arrogant as you used to talk as if you dont care about things. You showed it that way. So, it kept going that way. Enough for these.
            
            <br>Rest i found u cute, u were still important me as i got someone who was talking to me, who was thinking for me thorda. I found someone to tell some things too
            
            <br>Note- The only sorrow is i didnt get to wish you happy bday on 04/20 as u never told me its your bday
            
            <br>Lets move to June-August:Started developing Feelings
            <br>June was fine, thorda sa arguements, lots of things to learn and share, lots of talks, you saying happy bday to me more than 100 times haha.
            I started doing other things fast fast to just talk to you. i always wanted to talk more, to tell everything in my mind to you. I wasted lots of time of yours lol.
            July-August mein i wanted to hug you whenever u said you were sad, i never said it, i always thought you are out of my limits and my reach, i was like if i will say something, my friendship will be over. 
            
            <br>I have some friends but i dont talk to them on social media, in real i dont share what i feel. I get to do that to you. Never needed to hide my bad or good as u were not judging.It was the best thing being with u.
            
            <br>So, my attraction and all started increasing more and more as i got to know u more. I was lucky to talk to someone like you.
            
            <br>impressions of your on me in June-August :-
            <br>1. kind
            <br>2. good person
            <br>3. Different aura
            <br>4. Smart
            <br>5. Arrogant but not by choice but by experience
            <br>6. Atheist
            <br>7. Angry but cute, Tough like outer part of coconut but soft like inner part
            <br>8. Dont care about things (just to show to others), actually you do care.
            <br>9. June mein i had impression that you are a bad person too at some points who doesnt even love their parents (for which i argued too), but it was more like your life is a roller coaster. Your father doesnt understand some things and you love your mom.
            
            <br>Now the last-------- September- Atlast confessed(after you pushed though lol)
            
            <br>Atlast on 5th September i did what i never thought i will. It was tough to accept too. I wont even call it confess,it was accept lol. If i tell you my true feelings, i get lusty feelings only 30% times, rest of the time , i think of being with you. I enjoy your company, your talks , your stories, your feelings. I dont know where we will head to , if it will be good or bad , but the time i am having with you is the best. 
            
            <br>Lots of fights after 5 Sept, i love you more lol now. More than ever. Ready to do anything for you. 
            
            <br>Thank you for everything. You really pushed me into-:
            <br>1. Studying
            <br>2. Being the better person
            <br>3. Looking after jobs
            <br>4. Learning new things
            <br>5. Work on my personality etc
            
            <br>I am really greatfull to you. I told one thing in chat today. "kisi ka rini nai rehna hai bas zindagi mein, khuddari hai, ahsaan nahi chaiye", but you did on me too many which i cant get rid of ever lol.
            
            <br>Note- You scold me so much huh . You are ganda bacha. Seriously now, i dont mind when you scold, when u call me looser, buffalo, gandu, chuttiya. First , i know you dont mean it. Second, even if you mean it, it is true, it is what it is.
